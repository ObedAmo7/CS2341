# Example of a simple Class

A simple class to implement a memory cell that can store a single integer value with an interface to read() and write() the value.


Topics: 
* Header files (splitting code, preprocessor guards)
* Constructor (explicit vs implicit conversion, initialization list)
* `const` member functions.
* Add class files to `CMakeLists.txt` and enable warnings for CMake.
* Doxygen: 
  - with `Doxygen Documentation Generator` installed in VS code type `/**` above a function.
  - install [doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) and run `doxygen .` in the terminal in the directory with your code.
